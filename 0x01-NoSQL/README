NoSQL is an approach to databases that represents a shift away from traditional relational database management systems (RDBMS)
Relational databases rely on tables, columns, rows, or schemas to organize and retrieve data

NoSQL databases do not rely on these structures and use more flexible data models

Categories of NOSQL

Key-value data stores:Stored values can be any type of binary object (text, video, JSON document, etc.) and are accessed via a key
Document stores:store self-describing JSON, XML, and BSON documents
Wide-column stores: store data in tables with rows and columns similar to RDBMS, but names and formats of columns can vary from row to row across the table
Graph stores:uses graph structures to store, map, and query relationships
